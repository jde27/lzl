# lzl
lazy latex

The syntax of Lazy LaTeX (lzl) is very simple. You mostly just write
in LaTeX, except for a few shortcuts.

EXAMPLE 1

# Theorem thm:pythag Pythagoras's theorem
  \[a^2+b^2=c^2\]

====> LaTeX:

\begin{Theorem}[Pythagoras's theorem]
\label{thm:pythag}
\[a^2+b^2=c^2.\]
\end{Theorem}

====> HTML:

<div class="Theorem" id="thm:pythag">(Pythagoras's theorem)
\[a^2+b^2=c^2\]
</div>

(As usual, you can use any environment name you want as long as you
define it in the head of your LaTeX document or in your CSS.)

EXAMPLE 2:

! An item
  - A subitem
  - Another subitem
! Another item
  ! A numbered subitem
- An unnumbered item

====> LaTeX:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item An item
  \begin{itemize}
    \item A subitem
    \item Another subitem
  \end{itemize}
  \item Another item
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item A numbered subitem
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\begin{itemize}
  \item An unnumbered item
\end{itemize}

====> HTML:

<ol>
  <li>An item
  <ul>
    <li>A subitem
    <li>Another subitem
  </ul>
  <li>Another item
  <ul>
    <li>A numbered subitem
  </ul>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>An unnumbered item
</ul>

EXAMPLE 3:

@ title The title of the document
@ author Me
@tex include aux-tex-file
@html include aux-html-file

====> LaTeX:

\title{The title of the document}
\author{Me}
\include{aux-tex-file}

====> HTML:

<title>The title of the document</title>
<meta name="author" content="Me"/>
contents of aux-html-file inserted verbatim

Note: lzl keeps writing header stuff while the first character of the
line is @. As soon as that stops, it moves on to parsing the body of
the document. To maximise readability, I put all the LaTeXy
\usepackage/\newcommand instructions in a separate file which I then
include using @tex include aux-tex-file, and all HTML head stuff like
<link rel="stylesheet"...> in a separate text file which gets includes
verbatim using @html include aux-html-file. Of course, this
aux-html-file should probably include the relevant MathJax script...
